FileCopy.java explainning:
If the user only input nothing or just one file this code will just tell user what dose this code need to run.
If the user input with one file and more names behind that, this code will make copys the content of the first file and name it by the names input by the user after the fist file. If the new copy has same name of origial exited file, it will automatically overwrite   it. The way this code print is by print each words on the input line.

FileTokens.java explainning:
This code works basicall the same as FileCopy.java but stronger. After copying the content to the new file, the code will shows how 
many lines were in the original piece of code and how many tokens were in each line.
The way this code print output is by printing words between spaces as a token, instead of word by word.

FileReverse.java explainning:
This code works simialarly like FileTokens. It prints outputs as tokens. Before the printing part, I added a function to reverse
String by using 'substring'. What this part of the function does is to call on of the value in the string and put it on an adder. Thenuse substring to call another value one before the called one, until all of the values are called. In this wall, the string will be 
reversed.
